# Feedback on Project Work
## Nathan Everett

In this file, I will compile your feedback (and grade) for your project homework problems in reverse chronological order. Please do not alter this file and if you do, make sure to add and commit the new version to your repository before turning in the next assignment. Thanks, Danny

## Assignment 2

Nathan, I think you found some good resources, but see my feedback below for a couple that might be good for next week. They will be a bit more readable, and also have some of the athematical details you will want. This is because I want you to dig into some of the mathematical models as you begin to understand more deeply what this effect is and how people go about modeling it. I think the AJP articles will help you a lot in this respect.

## Assignment 1

Nathan, I'm writing this feedback a week late because I just got your assignment 1. It looks very good and I'm glad that it's motivated by your future interests. That's important that you find this interesting and helps you with your future work. I think digging specifcally into the Meisnner effect is a good one. I'm going to provide you with some additional resources that might be a touch more readable to start. I find AJP a bit more readable to start:
